Project Name:Boom Bikes
Outline a brief description of your project: This project involves building a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict the daily demand for shared bikes using historical data. The dataset (day.csv) contains various features including weather conditions, seasonal indicators, and other temporal attributes that influence bike rentals.

Background: To predict daily bike-sharing demand for Boom Bikes.
Business problem:You are tasked with building a multiple linear regression model to predict daily bike-sharing demand for Boom Bikes, a US-based provider impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to help them create a data-driven business strategy post-lockdown.
What is the dataset that is being used: download.csv
Conclusions:
Model Performance: The R-squared score shows how much of the variation in bike demand can be explained by the selected features. A higher score indicates a better fit.
Key Influencing Features:Variables like temperature, season, weather situation, and year significantly influence bike demand. These features have strong relationships with the target variable (cnt).
Positive Correlations: Higher temperatures and clear weather are associated with increased bike usage. Seasonal effects (like summer or fall) also contribute positively.
Model Assumptions: The residuals distribution appears normal, supporting the validity of linear regression assumptions like linearity and homoscedasticity.
Technologies Used- Programming Language
Python: Main language used for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization
