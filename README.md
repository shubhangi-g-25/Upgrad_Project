Boom Bikes

Outline a brief description of your project: This project involves building a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict the daily demand for shared bikes using historical data. The dataset (day.csv) contains various features including weather conditions, seasonal indicators, and other temporal attributes that influence bike rentals.

## General Information
This project involves developing a predictive analytics model to forecast daily demand for shared bikes using historical rental data provided by BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing company. In the wake of reduced ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is looking to recover by understanding which factors most influence bike usage — such as weather conditions, seasons, holidays, and workdays — to optimize resource planning and marketing efforts.

The dataset includes various features like temperature, humidity, windspeed, season, weekday, and type of users (casual vs. registered). The project focuses on modeling the total bike rental count (cnt) using multiple linear regression. The goal is not just to predict future demand but also to derive business insights about user behavior, helping BoomBikes make data-driven decisions as the market normalizes post-pandemic.

## Conclusions
The bike-sharing demand prediction project successfully developed a multiple linear regression model to estimate daily bike rental counts for BoomBikes based on historical data. Key factors such as temperature, season, year, working days, and weather conditions were found to significantly impact demand. The model demonstrated good predictive performance, as reflected by a high R-squared score on the test data. These insights provide BoomBikes with a clearer understanding of customer behavior and demand patterns, enabling them to make informed, data-driven decisions about inventory planning, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts as they prepare for a post-pandemic recovery.
